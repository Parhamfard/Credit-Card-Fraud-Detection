Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using various machine learning and deep learning models. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with a very small percentage of fraudulent transactions. The project compares the performance of models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Deep Learning to determine the most effective approach for fraud detection.

Key Metrics Evaluated: Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC.

Best Performer: Deep Learning, with the highest recall and ROC-AUC score, making it the top choice for identifying fraudulent transactions.
